                      In contrast, moving in electric mass transit emits about

                      Carbon credit is the generic term to assign a value to a
                      reduction or offset or avoidance of greenhouse gas
                      emissions, usually equivalent to one tonne of carbon
                      dioxide equivalent (CO2-e). Companies buy to negate
                      unavoidable emissions, and/ or for branding as they have
                      to move to net zero carbon. Tech firms, Data centres,
                      Airlines, Auto companies, Oil majors, Consumer brands
                      typically buy these.

                      O2Club's blockchain solution creates an unalterable record
                      of transactions with end-to-end encryption, making it
                      harder to fraud and unauthorized activity. Additionally,
                      data on the blockchain is stored across a network of
                      computers, making it nearly impossible to hack. This makes
                      the system reliable and easy to understand for users and
                      purchasers of the carbon rewards.{" "}

                      One of the biggest challenges as outlined by the OECD is
                      making the capital reach the right places fast and
                      consistently to induce fast action. Blockchain is the
                      solution that promises to bridge the world with one
                      transparent common ledger that cannot be manipulated.
